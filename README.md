+ In this project, I will find a linear function on some data sets using Linear regression methodology and gradient descent algorithm for optimization. Linear regression is a statistical technique that models the linear relationship between a dependent variable y and one or more independent variables x. The gradient descent refers to changes in the model moving along the slope or slope of the graph toward the lowest possible error value. 
+ The data set is about the strength of concrete when concrete is mixed up with several ingredients. In the data set, 8 feature values affect the strength of concrete. 
+ More specifically, Iâ€™m going to build a program to figure out the proper linear model by adopting Uni-variate and Multi-variate regression. Uni-variate linear regression is y = mx + b and multi-variate is y = b0 + m1*x1 + m2*x2 + .. + mn*xn. And I will use MSE(Mean Squared Error) as a loss function. The program can use one feature from the data set or all 8 features to find a linear function. It can be done by designating parameters.
